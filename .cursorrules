# Cursor Rules for Vue/TypeScript Project

## Code Style

- Use TypeScript for all new files
- Prefer composition API over options API in Vue components
- Use `<script setup>` syntax for Vue components
- Always put `<template>` first, ahead of `<script>`
- Follow existing code style and patterns in the project
- Use meaningful variable and function names

## Vue Specific

- Use `ref()` and `reactive()` for state management
- Prefer `computed()` over methods when possible
- Use `defineProps()` and `defineEmits()` for component props/events
- Keep components focused and single-purpose

## TypeScript

- Use strict type checking
- Define interfaces for complex objects
- Use type assertions sparingly
- Prefer `interface` over `type` for object shapes

## File Organization

- Keep components in `/src/components/`
- Keep views in `/src/views/`
- Use kebab-case for component file names
- Group related functionality together

## Performance

- Use `v-memo` for expensive list rendering
- Lazy load components when appropriate
- Avoid unnecessary re-renders

## General

- Write self-documenting code
- Add comments for complex logic
- Keep functions small and focused
- Use modern JavaScript/TypeScript features
